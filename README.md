# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-On-Crimes-In-Austin
Using python to perform exploratory data analysis on crime dataset from the City of Austin website.

This is the project where I had my first real taste of using Python to do something meaningful. I chose to do the exploratory data analysis in Austin because I live here and heard about the spike in crime rate around the time I was contemplating on the topic for an EDA project. 

The dataset has over 2 million rows and 27 columns. After using Pandas for cleaning and organizing the dataset to be able to provide a clearer picture of the crime stats, I began the data analysis. Data analysis was largely done using Pandas to classify crimes based on categories, location and temporal parameters such as hour of day, day of the week, month of the year and year-wise analysis. For data visualization, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly were used as needed. Folium was used for geospatial mapping based on GPS data of the crimes. Location analysis was done based on zip codes as well. 

The results showed that homicides doubled in 2020 compared to the average of the 18 years prior. Location analysis showed some zip codes closer to the town center as having higher number of crimes. But this could be due to the fact that these zip codes were populated well before the surrounding areas were urbanized. Overall, the project helped me appreciate the level of work that local law enforcement agencies need to put in to improve the statistics.
